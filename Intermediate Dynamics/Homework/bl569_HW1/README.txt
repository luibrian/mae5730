Question 1 is within hw1_1.
Figure 1 displays part a. Figure 2 displays parts b and d. Figure 3 displays parts c and e. 

Question 5 is within hw1_5. 
The figure displayed is the moving smiley face.

Just run it and outputs should follow. 
If you want to change variables, it should be pretty obvious where to change it within the code (the code is commented). 

Parts b/d and c/e of question 1 are done together on the same figures (figures 2 and 3 respectively).
