This homework covers number 34-37

But MATLAB for only 36. 

- num36_eccentricCylinder is the file to run to get plots.
- num36_derive derives the EOM.
- rhsStuffbVector and rhsStuffMassStuff are the outputs of the derive file. 

Figure 1: theta vs t
Figure 2: s vs t

Note: s = r*theta, so these are really the same plots just scaled. 

So I think I made a mistake somewhere in my derivation plugging it in. Very likely a typo, ie. swapping out an x with a y. Will take forever to debug, and it's 3AM rn.
I probably should've tried plugging my hand calcs of the EOM to see whether they're right. Future hw redo opportunity? 


Quite honestly, I apologize for the hw. It's been a long week, with FM2 lab report due and I haven't started studying for my controls prelim tomorrow. Please be kind. 

Also, I don't know if anyone has said this before, but mad respect for TAing this class. Especially having to deal with these homeworks. You guys rock!
