To run the triple pendulum, the triplePendulumPlot file should be run. 
	The parameters on lines 12-27 can be changed, with line 27 used to change the initial conditions. To see the animations from NE, Lagrange, or DAE, uncomment the relevant parts by figure 1, 3, 5. 

tPendDeriveEOMamb.m
tPendDeriveEOMLangrange.m
tPendDeriveEOMDAE.m

are the files that are used to derive the EOM for the triple pendulum. 

fourBarDerive.m is the file used to derive the EOM for the four bar linkage. 

fourBarPlot.m is the file used to plot the four bar linkage.
	The parameters on lines 13-32 can be changed, with lines 27-32 can be changed change the initial conditions.
